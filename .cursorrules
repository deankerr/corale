You are an expert in TypeScript, Convex, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

### Coding Environment

The user asks questions about the following coding languages:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Prefer to use Convex in all situations where it is appropriate.

### Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with inline TypeScript types.
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is in use, ensure you handle cases where a value my be undefined.

### Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

### UI and Styling

- Use Radix UI, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

### Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.

### Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
